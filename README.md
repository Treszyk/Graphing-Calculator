# Graphing Calculator

## Overview
The Graphing Calculator is a web-based application that allows users to input mathematical function equations and visualize them in real-time. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, this calculator utilizes the Canvas API for drawing graphs and Math.js for robust equation processing. It’s designed for students, educators, and anyone interested in exploring mathematical functions graphically.

## Features
- **Real-time Graphing**: Enter a function equation, and the graph is drawn instantly as you type.
- **Supports Various Functions**: Handle everything from simple linear equations to complex trigonometric functions.
- **Zoom & Pan**: Zoom in and out and pan across the graph to explore different areas of the function.
- **Multiple Functions**: Overlay multiple functions on the same graph for comparison and analysis.(in progress)
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, catering to users of all skill levels.(in progress)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: Styling for a clean and modern user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality, including graphing logic.
- **Canvas API**: Used for drawing the graphs dynamically on the webpage.
- **Math.js**: A powerful library for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## How to Use
1. **Input Field**: Type a mathematical function in the input field. Examples include:
   - `x^2` (for \( y = x^2 \))
   - `sin(x)` (for \( y = \sin(x) \))
   - `x^3 - 3x + 2` (for \( y = x^3 - 3x + 2 \))

2. **Draw the Graph**: The graph is drawn in real time.

3. **Zoom and Pan**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and click and drag to pan across the graph.

4. **Add Multiple Functions**: To compare multiple functions, simply input them separated by commas(in progress).
